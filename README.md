# BODY_MASS_INDEX (BMI)
The analyzing a BMI dataset, we examine the information to understand patterns related to people's height, weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI).
We check for missing or inconsistent data and clean it if necessary. We calculate summary statistics to get an overall view of the dataset, such as average BMI values and the range of heights and weights. We categorize individuals into weight status categories, like underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. We can also analyze how BMI varies across different genders and age groups. Visualizations, such as charts or plots, help us see trends and relationships between variables. By analyzing the BMI dataset, we can gain insights into weight patterns, potential health risks, and the population's overall distribution of BMI values.
